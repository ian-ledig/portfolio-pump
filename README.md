## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a React-based web framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation and fast development workflows.

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) for a fast and efficient start.
